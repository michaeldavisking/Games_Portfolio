About
======
I am a Creative Technologies MFA student at Virginia Tech. I work primarily with Virtual Reality and Games which I work on alone and with teams. Some of these projects are visible here with breakdowns of my contributions.

When I first opened the Unity Game Engine in 2018 I was excited to make games. Since then I have worked with other students, colleagues, and international teams on personal projects and game jams. I have also expanded my Game Engine knowledge into Unreal Engine 5 and gained familiarity with Reaper Audio and Blender to make my own assets.

I am a beliver that game development can be done by anyone if they put in the work. I have taught and continue to teach people how to use Unity and Unreal so that we can live in a world with more good games.
