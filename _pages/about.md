About
======
I am a Creative Technologies MFA student at Virginia Tech and expected to graduate in 2026. I work primarily with Virtual Reality and Games which I work on alone and with teams. Some of these projects are visible here with breakdowns of my contributions.

When I first opened the Unity Game Engine in 2018 I was excited to make games. Since then I have worked with other students, colleagues, and international teams on personal projects and game jams. I have also expanded my Game Engine knowledge into Unreal Engine 5 and gained familiarity with Reaper Audio and Blender to make my own assets.

I am a beliver that game development can be done by anyone if they put in the work. I have taught and continue to teach people how to use Unity and Unreal so that we can live in a world with more good games.

Skills

This project was displayed in the 2024 pop-up exhibition at Bird Block Gallery and Ceramics Studio “Bird Bonk”. It was made to be a simple interaction so that all ages and experience levels would be able to put on the headset and understand what to do.

Particles use a Niagara Particle that is bound to a spline path by several simulated physics forces. All the forces are adjustable and can affect the form the particle stream takes as each of the 15000 particles make their way around the spline.

Guests are able to push the particles out of the way using their hands which have point forces that are updated to the hand locations every frame.

This work was born out of my experimentation with Boids in both Unity and Unreal Engine 5. Boids, developed by Craig Renolds in 1987, are small objects that use a small set of rules to create flock-like behaviors. For me they were an introduction to emergent behaviors in games.

The Boids, dressed as paper airplanes, were able to change color and avoid the outer walls of a sphere game object in Unity. Their interactions with each other and the enclosure was interesting to me, but the lack of Guest input made me change direction to something more easily influenced.
